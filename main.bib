Abstract = {{Two-dimensional networks inspired by graphene are of prime importance in
   nanoscience. We present a computational study of an infinite molecular
   sheet confined on a water surface to assess its properties and formation
   mechanism. Terpyridine-based ligand molecules are interlinked by Zn ions
   to form an extended 2D metal-organic framework. Weshow that the network
   is stable on the water surface, and that the substrate affects the
   dynamic properties of the sheet, exhibiting a confining effect and
   flattening the sheet by 30\%. Weuse metadynamics to characterize the
   process of network formation and breaking and determine an intra-network
   binding energy of 143 kJ mol(-1). Based on this mechanistic insight we
   propose that the 2D network strength can be tuned by varying the
   rigidity of the ligand through its chemical structure.}}

Title = {{Computational Studies Of Atmospherically-Relevant Chemical Reactions In
   Water Clusters And On Liquid Water And Ice Surfaces}},
Journal = {{Accts. Chem. Res.}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{399-406}},
Abstract = {{Reactions on water and ice surfaces and in other aqueous media are
   ubiquitous in the atmosphere, but the microscopic mechanisms of most of
   these processes are as yet unknown. This Account examines recent
   progress in atomistic simulations of such reactions and the insights
   provided into mechanisms and interpretation of experiments. Illustrative
   examples are discussed. The main computational approaches employed are
   classical trajectory simulations using interaction potentials derived
   from quantum chemical methods. This comprises both ab initio molecular
   dynamics (AIMD) and semiempirical molecular dynamics (SEMD), the latter
   referring to semiempirical quantum chemical methods.
   Presented examples are as follows: (i) Reaction of the (NO+)(NO3-) ion
   pair with a water cluster to produce the atmospherically important HONO
   and HNO3. The simulations show that a cluster with four water molecules
   describes the reaction. This provides a hydrogen-bonding network
   supporting the transition state. The reaction is triggered by thermal
   structural fluctuations, and ultrafast changes in atomic partial charges
   play a key role. This is an example where a reaction in a small cluster
   can provide a model for a corresponding bulk process. The results
   support the proposed mechanism for production of HONO by hydrolysis of
   NO2 (N2O4). (ii) The reactions of gaseous HCl with N2O4 and N2O5 on
   liquid water surfaces. Ionization of HCl at the water/air interface is
   followed by nucleophilic attack of Cl on N2O4 or N2O5. Both reactions
   proceed by an SN2 mechanism. The products are ClNO and ClNO2, precursors
   of atmospheric atomic chlorine. Because this mechanism cannot result
   from a cluster too small for HCl ionization, an extended water film
   model was simulated. The results explain ClNO formation experiments.
   Predicted ClNO2 formation is less efficient. (iii) Ionization of acids
   at ice surfaces. No ionization is found on ideal crystalline surfaces,
   but the process is efficient on isolated defects where it involves
   formation of H3O+-acid anion contact ion pairs. This behavior is found
   in simulations of a model of the ice quasi-liquid layer corresponding to
   large defect concentrations in crystalline ice. The results are in
   accord with experiments. (iv) Ionization of acids on wet quartz. A
   monolayer of water on hydroxylated silica is ordered even at room
   temperature, but the surface lattice constant differs significantly from
   that of crystalline ice. The ionization processes of HCl and H2SO4 are
   of high yield and occur in a few picoseconds. The results are in accord
   with experimental spectroscopy. (v) Photochemical reactions on water and
   ice. These simulations require excited state quantum chemical methods.
   The electronic absorption spectrum of methyl hydroperoxide adsorbed on a
   large ice cluster is strongly blue-shifted relative to the isolated
   molecule. The measured and calculated adsorption band low-frequency
   tails are in agreement. A simple model of photodynamics assumes prompt
   electronic relaxation of the excited peroxide due to the ice surface.
   SEMD simulations support this, with the important finding that the
   photochemistry takes place mainly on the ground state.
   In conclusion, dynamics simulations using quantum chemical potentials
   are a useful tool in atmospheric chemistry of water media, capable of
   comparison with experiment.}}

Pages = {{207-222}},
Abstract = {{This article offers an overview of the recent progress in theoretical
   modelling of molecular reactions of atmospheric interest. The review
   covers processes in isolated molecules, e. g. vibrational
   overtone-induced processes in HNO(3) and H(2)SO(4). Another focal topic
   is thermally, as well as overtone-induced processes of NO(x), HNO(x) and
   other atmospherically relevant species in water clusters, the latter
   serving as models for water surfaces, aerosols and other water
   environments. Among the processes examined in water clusters are
   separations of NO(x) and HNO(x) into ion pairs in contact with water,
   and the reverse processes of anion/cation recombination to form neutral
   molecules. Physical insights into the mechanisms and properties of the
   processes, as extracted from theoretical simulations, are analysed. The
   methodology discussed in the review is mostly classical molecular
   dynamics simulations, using potentials directly from electronic
   structure methods. The merits and limitations of different electronic
   structure methods for the systems of interest are discussed. Limitations
   and open problems with regard to the classical dynamics approximation
   are also briefly examined. Concluding remarks are presented on the
   usefulness of classical dynamics with ab initio potentials for reactions
   of atmospheric chemistry. Possible directions for future progress are
   suggested.}}

Abstract = {{The Car-Parrinello (CP) method made molecular dynamics simulation with
   on-the-fly computation of interaction potentials from electronic
   structure theory computationally feasible. The method reformulates ab
   initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) as a two-component classical dynamical
   system. This approach proved to be valuable far beyond the original CP
   molecular dynamics method. The modern formulation of Born-Oppenheimer
   (BO) dynamics is based on the same basic principles and can be derived
   from the same Lagrange function as the CP method. These time-reversible
   BO molecular dynamics methods allow higher accuracy and efficiency while
   providing similar longtime stability as the CP method. AIMD is used in
   many fields of computational physics and chemistry. Its applications are
   instrumental in fields as divers as enzymatic catalysis and the study of
   the interior of planets. With its versatility and predictive power, AIMD
   has become a major approach in atomistic simulations. (C) 2011 John

Abstract = {{We introduce a powerful method for exploring the properties of the
   multidimensional free energy surfaces (FESs) of complex many-body
   systems by means of coarse-grained non-Markovian dynamics in the space
   defined by a few collective coordinates. A characteristic feature of
   these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term
   that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient
   exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the
   collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach
   in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the
   study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.}},

   Mechanical Behavior. Intensive Investigations Of Enzymes Under Their

   & Hall, New York, (1980)], Or As Corner-Cutting [Truhlar Et Al., J
   Chem. Phys. 100, 12771 (1996)]. This Worked Well As Long As The
   Observed Properties Could Be Explained By "Corrections" To
   Transition-State Theory. However, Over The Past Several Years,
   Enzymatic Behaviors Have Been Observed That Are So Deviant As To Lie
   Outside Of Transition-State Theory. This Phenomenon Is Discussed In The
   Context Of The Enzyme, Soybean Lipoxygenase. An Environmentally Coupled
   Hydrogen-Tunneling Model Is Presented That Derives From The Treatments
   Of Kuznetsov And Ullstrup [Can. J. Chem. 77, 689 (1999)], And Includes
   Heavy-Atom Reorganization (Temperature-Dependent And Largely
   Isotope-Independent), Together With Heavy-Atom Gating (Temperature- And
   Isotope-Dependent). This Treatment Can Explain A Wide Range Of
   Behaviors And Leads To A New View Of The Origin Of Kinetic Isotope
   Effects In Hydrogen-Transfer Reactions. These Properties Link Enzyme
   Fluctuations To The Hydrogen-Transfer Reaction Coordinate, Making A
   Quantum View Of H-Transfer Necessarily A Dynamic View Of Catalysis.},
